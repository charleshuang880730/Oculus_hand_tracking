# Four Arms! Omitrix comes to real in Virtual Reality (VR)

## Overview
**Four Arms! Omitrix comes to real in Virtual Reality (VR)** is a Virtual Reality (VR) system developed using **Oculus and Unity**. It enables users to control **four virtual arms** simultaneously for enhanced object interaction and manipulation in VR environments. This project explores how users adapt to extended bimanual tasks and aims to improve VR interaction techniques.

## Features
- **Multi-arm Interaction**: Control four virtual arms with intuitive hand gestures.
- **Hand Tracking**: Uses **Oculus Quest 2** and **OVR Skeleton** for real-time hand tracking.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Implements FABRIK algorithm for realistic arm movement.
- **Gesture-based Control**: Different gestures enable natural hand-arm coordination.
- **VR Environment**: Built in **Unity** with Oculus SDK support.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- **Oculus Quest 2**
- **Unity 2020+**
- **Oculus Integration Package**
- **OVR Skeleton Hand Tracking**

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in **Unity**.
3. Import **Oculus Integration** and set up **hand tracking**.
4. Build and deploy to **Oculus Quest 2**.

## How It Works
- **Hand Mapping**: Maps index and middle fingers to virtual arms for intuitive control.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Uses predefined hand gestures to control different arm movements.
- **IK Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts arm positioning for better usability.
- **VR Interaction**: Allows users to pick up and manipulate objects with all four arms.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** for smoother arm movement.
- Introduce **voice commands** for more intuitive interactions.
- Optimize **gesture recognition** for better accuracy.
